    <h2> Ingredient list for mango sorbet with only 3 items!</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li> 3 large, ripe mangoes </li>
            <li> 200g caster sugar</li>
            <li> 1 lime </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Peel the mangoes with a vegetable peeler, cut as much of the flesh away from the stone as you can, put it in a food processor or blender.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar, lime juice and 200ml water. Blend for a few minutes, until the mango is very smooth and the sugar has dissolved rub a little of the mixture between your fingers, if it still feels gritty, blend for a little longer. Pour into a container and put in the freezer for a few hours. </li>
        <li>Scrape the sorbet back into the blender if it is very solid, leave at room temperature for 5-10 mins first. Whizz until you have a slushy mixture, then pour back into the tin and freeze for another hour or so. </li>
        <li>Repeat step 3. Freeze until solid (another hour or two). Will keep covered in the freezer for three months. </li>
    </ol>
